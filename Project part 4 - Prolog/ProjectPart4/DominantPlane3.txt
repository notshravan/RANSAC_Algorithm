Prompt: > (plane-ransac "Point_Cloud_3_No_Road_Reduced.xyz" 0.99 0.8 1)
I chose: Confidence = 0.99, percentage = 0.8, eps = 1.

Result: '(plane, support) pair

'((229.94989483757064 -214.67214789636765 154.76452320423837 1042.5808362279174) . 2376)

Breakdown:
This means that the most dominant pane is characterized my the following equation:
A = 229.94989483757064
B = -214.67214789636765
C = 154.76452320423837
D = 1042.5808362279174

The support (%pts that support plane) is the last element in the list :. 2376
