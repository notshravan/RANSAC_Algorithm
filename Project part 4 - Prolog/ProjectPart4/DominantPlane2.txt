Prompt: > (plane-ransac "Point_Cloud_2_No_Road_Reduced.xyz" 0.99 0.8 1)
I chose: Confidence = 0.99, percentage = 0.8, eps = 1.

Result: '(plane, support) pair

'((127.56378083536654 -202.79672446512345 29.39294827560541 -1892.847509022202) . 431)

Breakdown:
This means that the most dominant pane is characterized my the following equation:
A = 127.56378083536654
B = -202.79672446512345
C = 29.39294827560541
D = -1892.847509022202

The support (%pts that support plane) is the last element in the list :. 431
