Prompt: > (plane-ransac "Point_Cloud_1_No_Road_Reduced.xyz" 0.99 0.8 1)
I chose: Confidence = 0.99, percentage = 0.8, eps = 1.

Result: '(plane, support) pair

'((-38.049596746669444 317.25070729455103 249.73979513693587 506.0220962084952) . 1295)

Breakdown:
This means that the most dominant pane is characterized my the following equation:
A = -38.049596746669444
B = 317.25070729455103
C = 249.73979513693587
D = 506.0220962084952

The support (%pts that support plane) is the last element in the list :. 1295
